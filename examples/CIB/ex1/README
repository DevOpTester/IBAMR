This is an example of mixture of prescribed and free DOFs for two bodies. The outer shell (structure 0) moves
relative to the inner sphere (structure 1). The mobility matrices (both fluid and body mobility) of two
structures are formed independently and are distributed to different processors (for parallel runs).
